title: Group
description: |-
  A group is used for hierarchising users and to group related resources togethers 

  A group is actually a user where the `is_group` and `is_locked` properties are always set to `true`. 
  Hence, its model is identical to the `User` one. This alias is provided for consistency and clarity.
x-examples:
  Neo:
    id: 1
    name: Neo
    email: null
    is_locked: true
    is_group: true
    branding: null
